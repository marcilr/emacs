Configuration of GNU Emacs


When Emacs is started, it normally tries to load a Lisp program from an
initialization file, or init file for short.  This file, l, or
~/.emacs.d/init.el; you can choose to use any one of these three names
(see Find Init).  Here, ~/ stands for your home direl, or ~/.emacs.d/init.el;
you can choose to use any one of these three names (see Find Init).  Here,
~/ stands for your home directory.

You can the command line switch '-q' to prevent loading your init file,
and -u (or '--user') to specify a different user's init file (see Initial
Options).

How Emacs Finds Your Init File
==============================
Normally Emacs uses the environment variable HOME (see HOME) to find .emacs;
that's what ‘~’ means in a file name.  If .emacs is not found inside ~/
(nor .emacs.el), Emacs looks for ~/.emacs.d/init.el (which, like ~/.emacs.el,
can be byte-compiled).
--gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Find-Init.html#Find-Init


Remove welcome splash
=====================
Remove second split window with "Welcome to GNU Emacs..." on startup.

Update ~/.emacs.d/inet.el with:

;; don't show splash screen
(setq inhibit-splash-screen t)


~/.emacs.d/inet.el
==================
Starting with Emacs 22, if ~/.emacs does not exist, Emacs will try
~/.emacs.d/init.el and ~/.emacs.d/init.elc.  You can also put the shell init
file .emacs_SHELL under ~/.emacs.d.

DotEmacsDotD (~/.emacs.d/)
============ 
The directory ~/.emacs.d/ is a standard location for additional per-user
Emacs-specific files.  Various packages store information in this directory.
Since it is located in the home directory (~/), it is unique for each user,
just like the ~/.emacs init file.  Note that as .emacs.d begins with a dot, it
is normally hidden on Unix systems and only turns up in directory listings if
all files and folders are shown (ls -a).

Starting with Emacs 22, if ~/.emacs does not exist, Emacs will try
~/.emacs.d/init.el and ~/.emacs.d/init.elc.  You can also put the shell init
file .emacs_SHELL under ~/.emacs.d.

Starting with Emacs 23, the variable user-emacs-directory holds the location
of .emacs.d.  On Windows, the location depends on the HOME environment
variable: if set to C:\, then .emacs is located at C:\.emacs and .emacs.d at
C:\.emacs.d.  On Windows 7 the default is
C:\Users\epich\AppData?\Roaming\.emacs and .emacs.d .

The user directory itself is not part of load-path, and since it contains
other things than libraries, you should leave it at that.  Instead, you should
install packages in a dedicated sub-directory (e.g., ~/.emacs.d/elisp) and add
that to the load-path instead.
