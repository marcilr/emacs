When Emacs is started, it normally tries to load a Lisp program from an
initialization file, or init file for short.  This file, l, or
~/.emacs.d/init.el; you can choose to use any one of these three names
(see Find Init).  Here, ~/ stands for your home direl, or ~/.emacs.d/init.el;
you can choose to use any one of these three names (see Find Init).  Here,
~/ stands for your home directory.

You can the command line switch '-q' to prevent loading your init file,
and -u (or '--user') to specify a different user's init file (see Initial
Options).

How Emacs Finds Your Init File
==============================
Normally Emacs uses the environment variable HOME (see HOME) to find .emacs;
that's what ‘~’ means in a file name.  If .emacs is not found inside ~/
(nor .emacs.el), Emacs looks for ~/.emacs.d/init.el (which, like ~/.emacs.el,
can be byte-compiled).
